What are the things that make full text search special?
How do you choose what to use?

##Stemming
###Q:
How do you avoid embedded words that should not show up in the search (ie. run inside of drunk)
###A: 
Stemming

##Stop words
Words that are meaningless to search and need to be added to an excluded list

##Tokenization
Contextualized groupings of words that have different meanings when grouped in different ways. More common with Asian languages than in english.


##Accuracy
* Its a tradeoff between accuracy and speed.
* How important are false positives (or the absence of)?
* How important are the top results compared with the exact number of results?

##Message to take home
* Learn how users use search on your site to inform your search implementation.
* Simple database based full text searches may work for your needs.

##Thoughts
* very cursory
* useful for a beginner overview of key concepts
