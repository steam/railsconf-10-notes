##Software is for people
Know the person, purpose, priority

##Three questions:

   * WHO is the user
   * WHY are they here?
   * WHAT is most important?

###WHO

*Exercises

   * Day in the life (go through person's life mentally - what are they doing throughout the day, especially when they are using your application)
      * Draw a timeline (see image from slides)
      * Usage helps identify key features or requirements
   * Gotta Wanna

###Why do they use the app?

   * Do they choose to? (intrinsic)
   * Has someone told them to use it? (extrinsic)
PURPOSE - Why are they here?

*Exercises

   * Back-seat driver - What would you tell them to click next (the thing you'd be frustrated if they missed).
   * Cotton-Eyed Joe - Where is the user in the flow of the application?

###PRIORITY
What is the most important element or action to be taken on the page.

*Exercises

   * MVP test (don't have more than 3 items in the hierarchy on the page)
      * Design for mobile (focuses on the most import things)
   * Design from the Inside Out
      * Focus on what matters most first
   * Evaluating the MVP
      * Squint Test
      * Font Size Test (make sure not to have more than 3 levels of hierarchy)
